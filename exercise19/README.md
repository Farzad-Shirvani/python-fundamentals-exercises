# Exercise 19: Perfect Number

A positive integer `n` is called *perfect* if the sum of all its divisors (excluding `n` itself) is equal to `n`.  
Write a program to check whether a given integer `n` is perfect.  
If it is perfect, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.

**Input:**  
- A single integer `n`.  
- Constraint: `2 ≤ n ≤ 200000`

**Output:**  
- Print `YES` if `n` is a perfect number.  
- Print `NO` otherwise.

Example 1:
```
Input: 18
```
```
Output: No
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 6
```
```
Output: yes
```
