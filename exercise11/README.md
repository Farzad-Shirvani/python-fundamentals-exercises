# Exercise 11: Find the Fourth Corner

You are given three corners of a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.  
Write a program that reads these three points and prints the coordinates of the fourth corner.

Input: Three lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), representing the coordinates of three corners of a rectangle.  
It is guaranteed that the three points are distinct and form a rectangle with non-zero area.

Output: One line with two integers `x` and `y` separated by a space, representing the coordinates of the fourth corner.

Example 1:

Input:  
```
2 3
6 3
2 5
```
Output:  
```
6 5
```

Example 2:

Input:  
```
5 2
1 2
5 6
```
Output:  
```
1 6
```
