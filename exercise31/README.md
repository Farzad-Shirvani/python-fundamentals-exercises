# Exercise 31: Prime Numbers in a Range

Given two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10,000), print all prime numbers between `a` and `b` (inclusive), each on a separate line.

It is recommended to define a function `is_prime(n)` that returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise.

### Input
Two lines:  
- First line: integer `a`  
- Second line: integer `b`

### Output
All prime numbers between `a` and `b` (inclusive), each on a separate line.

Example 1:  
Input:
```
4
19
```
Output:
```
5
7
11
13
17
19
```

Example 2:  
Input:
```
5
