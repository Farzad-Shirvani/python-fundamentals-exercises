# Exercise 12: Reverse Compare
You are given two three-digit integers.  
Compare them by reversing their digits.  

- Print `a < b` if reversed(a) < reversed(b)  
- Print `a > b` if reversed(a) > reversed(b)  
- Print `a = b` if reversed(a) = reversed(b)  

Input: Two lines, each containing a three-digit integer.

Output:  
One line with the comparison in the format:    
`number1 < number2`, `number1 > number2`, or `number1 = number2`.

Example 1:  
Input: 
```
351
245  
```
Output:
```
351 < 245
```

Example 2:  
Input:
```
455
323
```
Output:
```
323 < 455
```
