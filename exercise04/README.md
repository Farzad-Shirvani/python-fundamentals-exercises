# Exercise 4: Mirror Clock

A mirror clock shows the reflection of the actual time.  
Write a program that converts the mirror time into the actual time.

Input: Two integers `a` and `b` on a single line:
- `a` (0 ≤ a < 12) is the hour hand position.  
- `b` (0 ≤ b < 60) is the minute hand position.  

Note: The values 12 and 60 will not appear as input.

Output: Print the actual time in the format `hh:mm`.   
Both hour and minute must be two digits (add a leading zero if needed).

Example 1:
```
Input: 3 50
```
```
Output: 09:10
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 0 0
```
```
Output: 00:00
```
