# Exercise 17: Reverse Number
  
Given an integer `n`, construct `m` as the reverse of its digits (read from right to left).  
Leading zeros in the reversed number should be removed.

**Input:**  
- A single integer `n`  
- Constraint: `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`

**Output:**  
- Print integer `m`, the reversed form of `n`.

Example 1:
```
Input: 34252
```
```
Output: 25243
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 755489
```
```
Output: 984557
```
