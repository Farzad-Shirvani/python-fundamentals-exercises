# Exercise 7: Maximum Land Division

You are given a square land and want to draw `n` roads on it. Each road is either horizontal or vertical, and no two roads overlap. The goal is to maximize the number of regions the land is divided into.

Input: A single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of roads.

Output: A single integer — the maximum number of regions.

## Explanation
- If `n = 3` and all 3 roads are horizontal, the land is divided into 4 regions.  
- If `n = 3` and you draw 1 horizontal and 2 vertical roads, the land is divided into 6 regions.

Example 1:
 ```
 Input: 5
 ```
 ```
 Output: 12
 ```

Example 2:
```
Input: 7
```
```
Output: 20
```
