# Exercise 35: Palindromic Base Conversion

You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where:
- `a` is a number written in base `b`.
- You must convert this number to base `c`.

After the conversion, check whether the resulting number (in base `c`) is a **palindrome** â€” meaning it reads the same forward and backward.

If it is a palindrome, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.
