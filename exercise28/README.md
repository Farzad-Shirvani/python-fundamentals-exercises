# Exercise 28: GCD of Five Numbers

Given five natural numbers, compute their greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Input
A single line containing five integers `a b c d e` (1 ≤ a,b,c,d,e ≤ 10000).

### Output
Print a single integer — the GCD of the five numbers.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2 4 6 8 20
```
```
Output: 2
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 2 5 4 7 9
