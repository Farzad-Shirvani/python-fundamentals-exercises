# Example 16: Sum Until Zero

Write a program that repeatedly reads integers from input until `0` is entered. After that, print the sum of all previously entered numbers (excluding the final zero).

**Input:**  
- Each line contains one integer.  
- At most 100 numbers are given.  
- Only one `0` appears at the end.  
- Other numbers are natural numbers â‰¤ 1000.  

**Output:**  
- Print the sum of all entered numbers (excluding the final zero).
